This software was originally developed by the University of Tennessee 
as part of the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering 
Experiments (DANSE) project funded by the US National Science 
Foundation (NSF), but is currently being developed as an Open Source 
project hosted on GitHub and managed by a consortium of scattering 
facilities.

Participating facilities include (in alphabetical order): 
the Australian National Science & Technology Centre for Neutron 
Scattering, the Bundesanstalt fur Materialforschung und prufung, the 
Diamond Light Source, the European Spallation Source, the Institut 
Laue Langevin, the ISIS Pulsed Neutron & Muon Source, the National 
Institute of Standards & Technology Center for Neutron Research, 
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Neutron Sciences Directorate, 
and the Technical University Delft Reactor Institute.
