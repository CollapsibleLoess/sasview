# It is actually possible to list all the old svn ignore properties:
#
# svn pg -R svn:ignore .
#
# But there's a whole load of useless stuff in there that is no longer used.
# Instead I did a clean build including the docs, ran the tests, and then ran
# sasview for a bit and then did a git status to see what extra stuff was being
# generated.
#
# Feel free to add more stuff to this as and when it becomes an issue.
