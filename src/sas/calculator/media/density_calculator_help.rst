How To
------

1. Molecular Formula: The chemical formula of ONE molecule or ONE atom. For 
mixtures, the ratio of the each molecules should be used; for example, 
(H2O)0.5(D2O)0.5.

2. Select input (molar volume or mass density) from combobox. Then type in the 
input value.

3. Click the 'Calculate' button to perform the calculation.

4. Outputs also include the molar mass (weight) that depends only on the 
chemical formula
