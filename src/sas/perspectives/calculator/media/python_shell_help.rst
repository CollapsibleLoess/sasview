Python Shell Tool
=================

Description 
-----------

This is a Python shell (PyCrust) provided with WxPython. An editing notebook 
will show up when a Python file is loaded from the 'New' or 'Open' menu. 

The 'Run' menu is added for the editor to be able to compile and run the Python 
code.

For the details about the Python, visit the website 
http://docs.python.org/tutorial/

The numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc, libraries are shipped with SasView. However, 
some functionalities of those packages may or may not work.

PyCrust includes its own Help menu in the shell window.

Note: Help() and Credits() do not work on Macs.
