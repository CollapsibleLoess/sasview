The .rst files here are work in progress, converting the model functions help 
file from html to restructured text.

model_functions_v0.html (if present) is the help file distributed with SasView v2.2.1.

model_functions-2.html (if present) is the current html generated from the 
.rst by PyCharm.

NIST_IGOR_SANS_Model_Docs_v4.10.pdf should be used as the primary reference 
for queries about the model descriptions, NOT model_functions_v0.html.
