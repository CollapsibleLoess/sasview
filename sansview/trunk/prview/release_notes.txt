   Version 0.2.2

	- Release date: 7/8/2008
	- Added option to normalize P(r) to 1, scale P_max to 1, or leave as is.
	- Fixed problem with changing the number of P(r) points.

   Version 0.2.1
	- Release date: 7/04/2008
	- Improved user interface.
	- Automated estimate of the number of terms.
	- I(q=0) and Rg are now outputs of the inversion.
	- Slit smearing has been added.
	- Constant background estimation.
	- Functionality to compare p(r) output with data from a file.
	- Functionality to change the number of p(r) points of the output dsitribution.

   Version 0.1.0

	- Release date: 5/28/2008
	- First version put together built on guiframe.

2- Downloading and Installing

	2.1- System Requirements:
		- Python version >= 2.4 should be running on the system

	2.2- Installing:
		- Get the code from svn://danse.us/sans/releases/prview-0.2.2
		- This application is also dependent on the following DANSE code:
			svn://danse.us/sans/releases/guitools-0.2.3
			svn://danse.us/sans/treleases/guicomm-0.1.0
			svn://danse.us/sans/releases/guiframe-0.1.2
			svn://danse.us/sans/releases/pr_inversion-0.2.1
		- The following modules are required:
			* matplotlib 0.91.4 (avoid 0.98.1)
			* numpy
			* scipy
			* wxpython

3- Known Issues

	3.1- All systems:
		Version 0.2.2:
		- The application only loads .txt files. The expected format is 2- or 3-column ascii.
    	- More than a single additional data set should be plottable on the P(r) graph.
    	- Additional data plotted on the P(r) graph should also be normalizable.
    	- If additional P(r) data is loaded after a scale change has been done, the loaded data appears in another window rather than on the same graph. If additional P(r) data is loaded while the scale of the P(r) graph is linear, the behavior is correct.
    	- The application will not load data files with a point at Q=0. The user will not be notified.


	3.2- Windows:
		- None

	3.3- Linux:
		- None

4- Troubleshooting

	- None

5- Frequently Asked Questions
