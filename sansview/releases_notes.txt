SansView 1.0

Package name: None

1- Version 1.0

	- Release date: 10/01/2009
  	- Implemented P(r) inversion (Indirect Fourier transformations).
	- Improved fitting and model caculation speed by a factor of ten.
  	- Supporting many more model functions.
	- Supporting P(Q)*S(Q) for most of the shape based form factors.
	- Added more distribution functions for the polydispersion calculations.
	- Added a bookmarking feature so that the results of the calculation can be recalled later.
	- Q range reset button is added.
	- Added a color bar in 2D data plots.
	- Added a model function detail button for an easy access to the model help from the fitting panel.
	- And much more. 
	
 - Previous Versions
 
	- Simultaneous fit of a number of different sets of data with/without the constraints. 
	- Loading and displaying 1D and 2D data of various formats.
	- 1D and 2D data fitting using Scipy or Park (a MC fitting optimizer) fit engine. 
	- 2D data manipulation and modeling. 
	- Supporting a number of standard model and model-independent functions including form factor and structure factor functions and their multiplications.  
	- Plug-in mechanism for data readers. 
	- Easy pop-up menu by mouse clicking on a given plot. 
	- Users arrange the various windows. 
	- Supporting varius 2D averaging methods : Circular, sectorslicer, annulus, boxsum, boxQx and boxQy.  
	- User defined Qrange (Qmin and Qmax) for both 1D and 2D data for fitting and modeling.  
	- The user can toggle between a number of different scales on all plots.
	- Save the fit panel or model panel status.
	- Support saving data in the formats of ASCII and xml.
