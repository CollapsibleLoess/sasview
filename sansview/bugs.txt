1- when the page is open not all the sizer are display sizer 4 and 1 
2- when selecting a model the focus is on the combox box so
 if trying to scroll down or up the model  change.i think not very stable
3-does the data field need to be a textcontrol since the user will never change
it
4-select a model from the model menu , hit close , select it again from the model menu :
the parameters don't appear
