- In the fit tab, when I hit enter in a parameter box, it should update. 
	Right now the only way to update is to click somewhere else.
- When fitting data with a model, the plotted model should have a proper name, not "Fitness"
- The constrained fit button should have a normal, fixed, size.
- The close tab button should be inside the tab it closes, like the fit button.
- If I load data, select if for fitting, then close the fit tab, I can't re-select it 
	for fitting if all other fit tabs are closed and I'm looking at the simultaneous fitting tab. 
- Chi squared should be updated when model parameters are changed.
- The parameters resulting from contraints should be updated on the fit panel.

- Why is the data label "Loaded Data data"? Can't we use the name of the file?
- Load the cyl_400_20.txt and cyl_400_40.txt files. Then add errors to each and perform 
   simultaneous fit with M0.length=M1.length. The M0 model has bad result. M1 is fine.
   
- When we start park everything freezes. That should be improved.
- If I do a simultenous fit and don't enter a constraint, it complains on
the status bar but still does something! If you complain, stop everything.


- Write a message to the status bar when points are skipped after changing scale/transform
