------------------------------------------------
Feature list:
- Change name from FitView to SansView
- The "add error" context menu item disappeared
- Change the "Fit Data1D" and "Fit Data2D" menu items to something more meaningful like "Select data for fitting".
- Provide help when Help -> Fitting help is selected.
- On the fit tabs, place the Close button next to the Fit button.

* Showing models only:
- Make sure that the model is replotted only after all changes have been done (not after each parameter has been changed).
- There is no need to replot when the Close button is hit.
- Add model descriptions in the sansmodels classes. Those should be displayed in the model/fit tab.
- Make sure the parameters appear when a model is selected.

* 1D fitting:
- Make sure 1D fit works (test)
- Make sure the simultaneous fitting works (test)
- Test with both SciPy and Park. Make sure the simultaneous fitting
is disabled wht SciPy is selected.
- Divided the parameter list into two groups: the main parameters (on top),
and a second group called "Dispersion", with all the dispersion parameters
(of the type radius.width).
- Add a tick box to include/exclude slit smearing or resolution smearing 
(depending on the data).
- Format the text for the min/max Q value so that it can be read properly.
 
* 2D fitting and modeling:
- Make sure 2D fit works (test)
- Make sure the Qx and Qy values are correct.
- Make sure the labels for Qx and Qy are correct.
- Add sector averaging interactors on the 2D images. The user should be able to drag the edges of the shape to change
the underlying sector parameters. The user should also be able to pop up a panel to set the sector parameters
by hand. The available sectors can be found in data loader.
- When sector averaging is used, a 1D plot of the sector's content should be plotted. It should change when 
the sector parameters change. (See SliceView).
- Rotational average should also be available from the context menu of a 2D plot.
- Ideally, the user should be able to toggle between different views for 2D fits: data, model, data-model.

* Future:
- Allow users to write their own data manipulations (plug-ins) for 1D and 2D (like SliceView does for 2D).   

* BUGS:
- Select a model from the Model menu, hit close, select it again from the Model menu: the parameters don't appear


------------------------------------------------
- In the fit tab, when I hit enter in a parameter box, it should update. 
	Right now the only way to update is to click somewhere else.
- When fitting data with a model, the plotted model should have a proper name, not "Fitness"
- The constrained fit button should have a normal, fixed, size.
- The close tab button should be inside the tab it closes, like the fit button.
- If I load data, select if for fitting, then close the fit tab, I can't re-select it 
	for fitting if all other fit tabs are closed and I'm looking at the simultaneous fitting tab. 
- Chi squared should be updated when model parameters are changed.
- The parameters resulting from contraints should be updated on the fit panel.

- Why is the data label "Loaded Data data"? Can't we use the name of the file?
- Load the cyl_400_20.txt and cyl_400_40.txt files. Then add errors to each and perform 
   simultaneous fit with M0.length=M1.length. The M0 model has bad result. M1 is fine.
   
- When we start park everything freezes. That should be improved.
- If I do a simultenous fit and don't enter a constraint, it complains on
the status bar but still does something! If you complain, stop everything.


- Write a message to the status bar when points are skipped after changing scale/transform

- [problem] looking for a way to reduce 2 fitting functions to 1
