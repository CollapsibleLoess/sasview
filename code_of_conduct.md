# SasView Community Code of Conduct

As a community, collaborative, development project, everyone interested in small
angle scattering is part of the community and invited to participate in the
SasView collaborative effort at whatever level they can/wish to and whenever
they are able. As such the SasView community operates by consensus as much as
possible and aims to not only be open and harassment-free, but actively
inviting and engaging to everyone regardless of age, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, or any other
distinguishing characteristic that could be viewed as “different.” The SasView
community believes these differences should be recognized and celebrated not
harassed or intimidated.

It is however also recognized that the realities of vastly different
experiences and perspectives may lead to tensions which can escalate to at
least the perception of harassment by one or another party. When such instances
occur and cannot, for whatever reason, be resolved by frank dialogue between
the parties, or as soon as any party feels unsafe, these should be brought
to the attention of the management team. In consultation with the community,
the management team will take whatever action is appropriate to ensure
everyone’s comfort and safety, but will first endeavor, whenever possible,
to resolve the issues through dialogue and communication that promotes mutual
understanding and respect. However, in egregious cases, and/or for cases where
the offending activity continues unabated, the management team, with the
consensus of the community, will remove access to SasView contribution
resources and ban the person from participating in group activities such as
code camps.


# Alternate Version - Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
management@sasview.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
