Inversionview is responsible for creating and maintaining the graphical
component of the P(r) inversion perspective. It uses the Guiframe
package to create the necessary panels and widgets. DataLoader is
used to transmit data to the GUI and the Pr_inversion package is used
to perform the actual P(r) inversion calculations.
