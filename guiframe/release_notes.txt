First cut at a GUI framework for SANS applications. 

Modules should be put in the "perspectives" directory
of their main application when using this framework.

Documentation to come...

To-do list:

	- If there is only one perspective, drop the perspective menu.
	- If there is only one panel in the Panel menu, drop the menu.
